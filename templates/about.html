    <h3>It is a primary machine learning and deep learning health care based app.</h3>
    <p>The prediction about the disease is performed with the help of the machine learning and deep learning model which itself is trained on thousands of datasets.</p>
    <p>So in the following paragraph, I am going to be describing the types of diseases which get used in this app.</p>
    <h2>1. Breast Cancer </h2>
    <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
       <img style="max-width: 600px" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='breast_img.png') }}"/>
   </div>
   <br>
    <p>Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. There are different kinds of breast cancer. The kind of breast cancer depends on which cells in the breast turn into cancer.<br></p>

    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
    <p>Signs and symptoms of breast cancer may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue</li>
      <li>Change in the size, shape or appearance of a breast
      </li>
      <li>
        Changes to the skin over the breast, such as dimpling
      </li>
      <li>
        A newly inverted nipple
      </li>
      <li>Peeling, scaling, crusting or flaking of the pigmented area of skin surrounding the nipple (areola) or breast skin</li>
      <li>Redness or pitting of the skin over your breast, like the skin of an orange</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p>Doctors know that breast cancer occurs when some breast cells begin to grow abnormally. These cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells do and continue to accumulate, forming a lump or mass. Cells may spread (metastasize) through your breast to your lymph nodes or to other parts of your body.<br>
Breast cancer most often begins with cells in the milk-producing ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma). Breast cancer may also begin in the glandular tissue called lobules (invasive lobular carcinoma) or in other cells or tissue within the breast.
<br>
Researchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle and environmental factors that may increase your risk of breast cancer. But it's not clear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer, yet other people with risk factors never do. It's likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and your environment.</p>

<h2>2. Diabetes</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
       <img style="max-width: 600px" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='diabetes-affects_img.jpg') }}"/>
   </div>
   <br>
<p>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy.</p>
<h3>What are the different types of diabetes?</h3>
<p>The most common types of diabetes are type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.</p>
<h3>Type 1 diabetes</h3>
<p>If you have type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. Your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, although it can appear at any age. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive.
</p>
<h3>Type 2 diabetes</h3>
<p>If you have type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood. However, this type of diabetes occurs most often in middle-aged and older people. Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes.
</p>
<h3>Gestational diabetes</h3>
<p>Gestational diabetes develops in some women when they are pregnant. Most of the time, this type of diabetes goes away after the baby is born. However, if you’ve had gestational diabetes, you have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Sometimes diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy is actually type 2 diabetes.
</p>
<br>
<h3>What health problems can people with diabetes develop? </h3>
<p>Over time, high blood glucose leads to problems such as</p>

 <ul>
  <li>Heart disease</li>
  <li>Stroke</li>
  <li>Kidney disease</li>
  <li>Eye problems</li>
  <li>Dental disease</li>
  <li>Nerve damage</li>
  <li>Foot problems</li>
</ul>

<h2>3.Malaria</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">

<p>
Malaria is a life-threatening disease. It’s typically transmitted through the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. Infected mosquitoes carry the Plasmodium parasite. When this mosquito bites you, the parasite is released into your bloodstream.</p><br>
<p>The severity of malaria varies based on the species of plasmodium.
Symptoms are chills, fever and sweating, usually occurring a few weeks after being bitten.
People travelling to areas where malaria is common typically take protective drugs before, during and after their trip. Treatment includes antimalarial drugs.</p>
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<ul>
    <li>High fever and chills</li>
    <li>Impaired consciousness</li>
    <li>Vomiting</li>
    <li>Headaches</li>
    <li>Muscle pain</li>
    <li>Deep breathing and respiratory distress</li>
    <li>Abnormal bleeding and signs of anemia</li>
    <li>Clinical jaundice and evidence of vital organ dysfunction</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4.Pneumonia</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
       <img style="max-width: 600px" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='pneumonia_img.jpg') }}"/>
   </div>
   <br>
  <p>Pneumonia is an infection in one or both lungs. It can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi.</p>
  <p>The infection causes inflammation in the air sacs in your lungs, which are called alveoli. The alveoli fill with fluid or pus, making it difficult to breathe.<p>
  <h3>Symptopms</h3>
 <p>Pneumonia symptoms can include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>coughing that may produce phlegm (mucus)</li>
    <li>fever</li>
    <li>fast breathing and shortness of breath</li>
    <li>shaking chills</li>
    <li>chest pain that usually worsens when taking a deep breath, known as pleuritic pain</li>
    <li>fast heartbeat</li>
    <li>fatigue and weakness</li>
    <li>sweating</li>
    <li>headache</li>
</ul>
